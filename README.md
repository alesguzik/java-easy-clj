[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/java-easy-clj.svg)](https://clojars.org/java-easy-clj)

A Java/Clojure library to easily call clojure code from java. It provides a high-level interface into clojure land via one static method.

## Usage

See `examples/` for sample java/maven projects using this library. Basically all you do is:

```java
import net.aguzik.java.EasyClj;

EasyClj.call("42") // => 42;

EasyClj.call("(+ a b)", "a", 2, "b", 3) // => 5

EasyClj.call("(require '[clojure.pprint :as pprint])")
EasyClj.call("(doseq [i (range len)] (pprint/pprint i))", "len", 10) // prints numbers from 0 to 9

```
